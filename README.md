# Kudo Kafka on Konvoy Demo

_NB: This is a work in progress. PRs and issues are most welcome._

## Background

This demo is designed to show a simple container running in Konvoy writing to Kudo Kafka. Another container reads from the Kudo Kafka stream and outputs the Kafka messages to logs, which you can follow to demonstrate.

The Kudo Kafka instance can be monitored via the built-in Grafana dashboard.
